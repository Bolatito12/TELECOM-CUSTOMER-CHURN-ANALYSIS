# TELECOM-CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS
This project is designed to transition the company's retention strategy from reactive recovery to proactive, data-driven defense. The primary aim is to minimize attrition and maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by focusing on the highest-risk, highest-value segments.

## Project Objectives:
• Financial Objective: Reduce the 16% Churn Rate to protect the $61.78K in Annual Revenue at Risk.

• Predictive Objective: Build a machine learning model to assign a Churn Risk Score and achieve 80% accuracy in identifying at-risk customers.

• Operational Objective: Prioritize fixing the 20+ Call Failure service threshold, the operational trigger causing significant churn spikes.

• Targeted Objective: Increase the retention rate of the financially-critical 'High Value - Low Engagement' segment.

• Commitment Objective: Implement early-life campaigns to secure contract commitment from the high-volume 'New - High Risk' segment.

• Behavioral Objective: Increase customer service usage (e.g., Frequency of Use) by 15% for high-risk customers to boost loyalty

##  Key Problems & Questions
1. What is the overall churn rate among telecom customers?
2. Which customer segments show the highest churn risk?
3. How does churn vary by plan type or subscription level?
